# Online Nursery Client ðŸŒ±

## Project Overview ðŸŒ±

The client side of the Online Nursery project is built using React with state management handled by Redux Toolkit. It integrates with Stripe for payment processing and provides a user-friendly interface for browsing products, managing the shopping cart, and completing purchases. The project is developed using modern tools and practices to ensure a smooth and responsive user experience.

## Features ðŸŒŸ

1. **Product Browsing and Management ðŸŒ¿**
   - Users can view a list of products, filter and sort them, and search for specific items.
   - Product details, including images and descriptions, are displayed on dedicated product pages.
   - -Suggested Categories: At the bottom of the product details page, users will see a list of suggested categories related to the current product. This helps users discover similar products or explore categories they might be interested in.

2. **Shopping Cart ðŸ›’**
   - Users can add products to their cart, view cart contents, and manage quantities.
   - The cart persists user selections and allows for easy checkout.

3. **Checkout and Payment ðŸ’³**
   - Secure payment integration using Stripe.js.
   - Users can choose to pay online with Stripe or opt for cash on delivery (COD).

4. **Responsive Design ðŸ“±**
   - The application is designed to work seamlessly on various devices and screen sizes.
   - Utilizes Tailwind CSS for modern, responsive UI components.

5. **State Management and Routing ðŸ”„**
   - Redux Toolkit manages the global state for products, cart, and user sessions.
   - React Router handles navigation across different pages.
     -RTK Query: Utilized for efficient data fetching and synchronization with the server. RTK Query simplifies data fetching, caching, and synchronization processes, reducing the need for manual state management and complex async logic.
